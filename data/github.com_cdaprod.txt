This script establishes a comprehens...
This script establishes a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process model using Pydantic, providing a structured approach to data pipeline construction. It features detailed class definitions for managing connection details, source data extraction, transformations, and data loading. It also includes models for lifecycle management, job control, data quality validation, auditing, and performance monitoring. The root validator ensures the integrity of the ETL structure, making the model robust and reliable for orchestrating complex data workflows. This script is an excellent starting point for building a sophisticated ETL pipeline that can handle diverse data sources and formats.
