Based on the detailed documentation from `unstructured`, here are concrete examples of using the library for the scenarios you mentioned. These examples are derived from the official `unstructured` documentation and illustrate the library's versatility in handling unstructured data【22†source】【23†source】【24†source】【25†source】【26†source】.

### 1. HTML Data Extraction

To extract data from HTML documents, you can use the `partition` function directly if the document is in a simple format. For more complex or specific scenarios like extracting and cleaning text, you might need to employ custom cleaning functions or utilize the `partition_html` function followed by relevant cleaning methods.

```python
from unstructured.partition.auto import partition
from unstructured.cleaners.core import clean_non_ascii_chars

# For remote HTML documents
elements = partition(url="https://example.com/document.html")

# Cleaning non-ASCII characters from extracted elements
for element in elements:
    cleaned_text = clean_non_ascii_chars(element.text)
    print(cleaned_text)
```

### 2. CSV File Processing

For processing CSV files, `unstructured` offers a dedicated `partition_csv` function. It processes CSV files and outputs a single `Table` element, including an HTML representation of the table in the element metadata.

```python
from unstructured.partition.csv import partition_csv

elements = partition_csv(filename="path/to/your/csvfile.csv")
print(elements[0].metadata.text_as_html)
```

### 3. Image Text Extraction

To extract text from images, you would typically need to integrate OCR capabilities. While the `unstructured` documentation does not provide a direct example for images, it mentions the use of `partition_pdf` with a `hi_res` strategy for high-quality text and table extraction from PDFs, which implies the library's capability to handle complex data extraction tasks, potentially including OCR for images when configured appropriately.

```python
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

# Assuming a similar approach can be applied for images with the correct setup
elements = partition_pdf("path/to/your/image.pdf", strategy="hi_res")
```

### 4. PowerPoint Presentations (PPTX)

While specific examples for PowerPoint presentations (PPTX files) were not found in the provided documentation, given `unstructured`'s extensive functionality, processing such files likely involves converting them into a supported format (e.g., PDF) and then using the `partition` function or a format-specific function like `partition_pdf` for extraction.

```python
# Hypothetical example after converting PPTX to PDF
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

elements = partition_pdf("converted_presentation.pdf")
```

For detailed guidance and additional functionalities like cleaning text or extracting specific elements from documents, refer to the `unstructured` documentation. It offers comprehensive insights into partitioning documents, cleaning data, and extracting valuable information from various unstructured data formats​​​​​​​​​​.
