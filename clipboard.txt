To continue with the PoC, I'll provide a simplified source code outline that demonstrates how to integrate Unstructured.io, MinIO, and Weaviate using Python. This source code will follow the previously described workflow: extracting data from URLs, transforming and storing it in MinIO, and then indexing it in Weaviate.

### Assumptions
- You have access to Unstructured.io, MinIO, and Weaviate services.
- Python libraries for these services (`unstructured`, `minio`, `weaviate-client`) are installed.
- This example assumes basic familiarity with Python and may require adjustments for specific use cases or data formats.

### Setup and Configuration

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. If not, you can install them using pip (note that `unstructured` here is a placeholder for the actual library you would use, which might require a direct API call or a custom implementation):

```bash
pip install minio weaviate-client
```

#### Initialize Clients

```python
from minio import Minio
from weaviate import Client as WeaviateClient
# Assuming `unstructured` is a library or a module you have for handling Unstructured.io's functionality

# MinIO Client
minio_client = Minio(
    "YOUR_MINIO_ENDPOINT",
    access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    secure=True
)

# Weaviate Client
weaviate_client = WeaviateClient(
    url="YOUR_WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT",
    auth_client_secret={
        "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    }
)
```

### Workflow Implementation

#### 1. Extract and Transform Data from URLs

Assuming you have a list of URLs (`urls_list`) and a function from `unstructured` that can process these URLs to return structured JSON data:

```python
def extract_and_transform(urls_list):
    structured_data = []
    for url in urls_list:
        # Assuming `process_url` is a method to extract and transform data
        data = unstructured.process_url(url)
        structured_data.append(data)
    return structured_data
```

#### 2. Store Data in MinIO

```python
def store_in_minio(data_list, bucket_name="your-bucket"):
    for data in data_list:
        object_name = f"{data['id']}.json"  # Assuming each data piece has a unique 'id'
        minio_client.put_object(
            bucket_name,
            object_name,
            data=json.dumps(data),
            length=len(json.dumps(data)),
            content_type='application/json'
        )
```

#### 3. Ingest Data into Weaviate

Before ingesting into Weaviate, ensure your schema is created to match the structured data format. The following example assumes a simple ingestion:

```python
def ingest_into_weaviate(data_list, class_name="WebDataset"):
    for data in data_list:
        weaviate_client.data_object.create(
            data,
            class_name=class_name
        )
```

#### Integration Example

```python
# Define your URLs list
urls_list = ["http://example.com/data1", "http://example.com/data2"]

# Extract and Transform Data
structured_data = extract_and_transform(urls_list)

# Store in MinIO
store_in_minio(structured_data, bucket_name="example-bucket")

# Ingest into Weaviate
ingest_into_weaviate(structured_data, class_name="WebDataset")
```

### Conclusion

This code provides a high-level overview and starting point for your PoC. The actual implementation might require adapting these snippets to fit the specific APIs and data structures of Unstructured.io, MinIO, and Weaviate. Additionally, handling authentication, error checking, and efficient data processing (e.g., batch processing for Weaviate) are crucial for a production-ready solution.

Would you need further details on any of these steps or additional assistance with another part of your PoC?
